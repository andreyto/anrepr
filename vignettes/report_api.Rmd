# Scope

This vignette demonstrates how you can start a report generation in your R code
by creating the `anrep` class, and then use the methods of this class to
add both structural and data elements to your report. 

Using the API is very similar to using a
typical logging library to emit some information from different places in your code.
Only in this case, you are emitting rich content such as plots and tables, as well
as organizing output into a hierarchical structure.

The report hierarchy is expressed through:

1. generation of multi-level section numbering
2. creation of multiple linked documents (called "subreports" 
   in the `anrep` documentation).

Overall, the feature set in the `anrepr` package allows easily equipping any arbitrarily 
complex analysis pipeline with a graphical reporting facility that emits report
elements within functions, loops or conditional branches. 

The typical final output
is an auto-generated static Web site that contains linked HTML pages, embedded and stand-alone
versions of the plots as well as saved data files. The Web pages will contain dynamic Java Script
elements if your code decides to report the types of R objects which implement the 
[*htmlwidgets*](https://cran.r-project.org/package=htmlwidgets) 
interface. The generated Web site directory is portable - it can be copied to other locations 
or computers and viewed directly from disk, or it can be deployed to a Web server.

# The reasons for creating this package

Popular R frameworks like Sweave and [RMarkdown](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rmarkdown) / 
[Knitr](https://cran.r-project.org/package=knitr) packages greatly facilitate reproducible research and graphical 
report generation by embedding analysis code into the documents written in a structured markup
languages such as LaTex, Markdown or HTML.
When the document is "rendered" by Knitr, the code chunks written in R are replaced by the results of their 
evaluation. 
A [large ecosystem of tools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/ReproducibleResearch.html) 
have been developed in the R community for automatically formatting various analysis objects into the markup 
representation.

One constraint imposed by such "*document-driven*" reporting approach is that the
flow of the analysis is controlled by the linear structure of the template document. Generation of the
reporting output from the embedded code will normally proceed from the top to the bottom of the 
document without branching or looping.

Recognizing a frequent need for a more flexible control over the flow of the report generation, knitr introduces 
both conditional evaluation tags and references between the chunks of code in the document. However, applying this advanced 
functionality imposes on the users an additional layer of programming that has to be done in a limited domain specific 
language (DSL) implicitly defined by the available knitr tags. The users have to learn this DSL and manage to express with it their reporting
workflows. This has to happen despite the fact that they are already writing their code chunks in the 
powerful general purpose programming language such as R.

The situation is similar with the very popular Python-centric literate programming framework [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/).

In our own everyday data analysis work in a bioinformatics research environment, we encounter a frequent pattern of activity where 
the report generation has to be embedded into a fairly complicated analysis workflow developed in a general purpose
programming language like R or Python. As the analysis proceeds through multiple stages of data loading, 
data cleaning and the iterative application of the same or different algorithms to the subsets of data, we often need to:

- Report on various transient data elements that are being generated deeply inside the nested function calls, loops and conditional branches
- Organize the report in a hierarchical structure to make viewing of a large report practical, even when the report includes tens of
  thousands of plots and tables
- Make both the reporting process and the analysis fully automated, so that it is easy to present the updated results to our
  research collaborators in frequent development iterations 
- Have the report in a format that can be easily archived and viewed offline in another location by the collaborators without any need 
  for the custom desktop or server applications
- Keep the effort required to either add or modify the reporting instructions for *both structure and content* of the report very low to let
  us concentrate on developing the analysis code. As a reasanoble trade off, we are willing to tolerate for the bulk of the report an 
  auto-generated document layout that might not be as polished as a layout coming out from a hand-tuned document template.

We have developed the R package `anrepr` that meets all of the above requirements by adopting the "*analysis-driven*" reporting approach.
In this approach, the analysis code is instrumented by including calls to our R package functions wherever the output has to be
reported during the analysis execution. The reporting becomes an integral and unobtrusive part of the analysis workflow.

Our package was in part inspired by the existing R packages [Nozzle](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Nozzle.R1) and 
[pander](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=pander), and it relies heavily on the Markdown generation methods provided by `pander`.

For example, the `Nozzle` package has implemented the "*analysis-driven*" reporting concept by providing an R API that directly generates 
rich HTML reports. `Nozzle` has implemented many advanced and specialized features such as dedicated presentation of the results
that were marked as "signficant" by the analysis pipeline and on-demand filtering-out of the sections marked as "private data".
The polished and thought-out JavaScript user interface (UI) of the `Nozzle` reports comes at a price of having many 
decisions hard-wrired at the HTML presentation layer, such as relying on a combination of JQuery and Nozzle's own JavaScript
libraries to control the UI elements. The `Nozzle` also creates a fixed top level HTML DOM structure that might fit perfectly
the requirements of the sample processing pipeline at the Broad Institute where this package was created, but not necessarily
fit well all external applications.

The `Nozzle` API provides a method for inserting report elements containing arbitrary HTML chunks for those users which
have sufficient skills for manipulating the HTML code.

In our work, we have adopted the approach taken by the `pander` package that provided a class `Pandoc` for generating reports in Markdown format. Our `anrep` class
can be viewed as a complete reimplementation of the `pander::Pandoc` class. The primary difference is that we provide automation 
for building a hierarchical structure for the reports, generating auto-numbered sections, captions and anchor links for all inserted
objects. The consistency of the numbering is maintained even in the presence of error conditions during execution of the analysis code.
In contrast, the `pander::Pandoc` does not provide any facilities for structuring the report beyond a generic ability for inserting header tags. 

The `pander::Pandoc` saves the entire report into a single file, which makes the final HTML reports impossible to
load into the Web browser when the number of plots or table rows inserted by the analysis pipeline becomes too large. The same
single-file scalability problem will be faced by the `Nozzle` report, where the documentation advises the users to trim down 
the size of the tables that they are inserting from their analysis pipeline.

Our class API provides protection against such viewer scalability issues in two ways:

- The user can tag any newly created section of the report in the API call as a "Subreport", in which case it will be saved into a separate file in
  most final output formats. The subreport will be linked from the parent report in case of HTML output.
- The number of table rows inserted into the Markdown file will be limited to a default number of 200 (this can be overridden by the user
  for each table). The full-size dataset will be always saved as a comma-delimited file in the report data directory and linked from the
  table caption.
- The htmlwidget object can be marked as "link-only" by the user if it is expected to be very expensive to render in the browser (for 
  example, if it is a multiple alignment object with thousands of sequences). In that case it will be only saved in a separate file and
  linked from its caption in the parent report.


The most fundamental distinction of our work from `Nozzle` is that our `anrep` class (as well as the `pander::Pandoc` class) emits Markdown text 
instead of HTML. Using Markdown aims to create more separation between content generation and the final presentation format that is typically
expected with the HTML output.

As a convenience, we provide infix operators for generating subsection and subreport hierarchy by wrapping blocks of the existing
analysis code with curly braces. We found that feature a big help in the rapid development of multiple project-specific research 
analysis pipelines with actively changing structure.

Package-level functions from the `pander` package are used to automatically convert a multitude of R data types 
into Markdown. That includes extraction of vector and raster images from plot objects produced by the major R graphing libraries. 
The `save()` method of our report class calls the well-known external `Pandoc` converter utility to turn the Markdown output into any of multiple final presentation formats, such as HTML pages and slide shows, or Word and PDF documents. Custom style sheet files and JavaScript libraries can be supplied by the users to completely change the appearance and behaviour of the rendered HTML pages.

Our report object detects if it is being ran from a `Knitr` document, and returns the entire assembled report to properly show up under `Knitr`, 
including all inserted dynamic `htmlwidget` objects. Users can also insert their own arbitrary Markdown or HTML text into the report. 
Markdown is very easy to write considering the simplicity of its syntax relative to, for example, HTML.

We have implemented dedicated methods in our `anrep` class for adding to the report the most frequently used R datatypes such as data frames, vectors and
plots with a single function call. That call generates Markdown content with a numbered caption and anchor, saves the full size element version on disk and 
links it from the caption, and 
seemlessly takes care of various edge cases that have to be taken into an account when directly using the conversion methods from the `pander` package. 
One of our class methods inserts R objects from a growing collection of packages which implement the `htmlwidgets` interface, thus allowing generating
a rich set of dynamic JavaScript elements in the final HTML reports.


# The minimal `Hello World` example

This code adds to the report two pairs of tables and plots using a `for` loop. You can see in the report output rendered by `Knitr` that
tables and plots were decorated with auto-generated captions. Consider, for example, this caption:

"

`(1.1)` <a name="table.2"></a>[`Table 2.`](#table.2) Hello Table for rows 29, 30, 20, 19, 2. Full dataset 
is also saved in a delimited text file (click to download and open e.g. in Excel) 
[`data/Table.2-1.1-1527b2eb7a167.csv`](data/Table.2-1.1-1527b2eb7a167.csv)

"

The caption starts with the current hierarchical numbering of the section where the corresponding object is contained at `(1.1)`. This is followed 
by the auto-generated object index `Table 2` that runs through the entire report separately for each object type such as table or plot types. 
In the HTML output, the object index is an anchor for sharing links to that place in the report. 
After that, the user-provided descriptive text is inserted, followed by the link to an auto-generated data or image file that can be used in 
downstream processing.

```{r hello1, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, cache=FALSE}
library(anrepr)
report = anrep("Hello World")
set.seed(1)
for(i in 1:2) {
  rows = sample(nrow(mtcars),5)
  
  report$add.table(mtcars[rows,1:6],
                   caption=sprintf("Hello Table for rows %s",
                                   paste0(rows,collapse = ", ")),
                   show.row.names = T)
  
  report$add(with(mtcars[rows,],plot(mpg,hp)),
             caption=sprintf("Hello Plot for rows %s",
                             paste0(rows,collapse = ", ")),
             graph.unify=T,
             hi.res=T)
}

# Printing the return value from the save() method will show
# rendered Markdown if running under Knitr, else write HTML
# and data files in the current directory.
report$save()
```

*************************************************************************
*End of the rendered output from the example code.*

*************************************************************************

*The raw generated Markdown from the Hello World example looks like this:*

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, cache=FALSE, comment=''}
cat(report$save())
```

*************************************************************************

# About running under `Knitr`

The report object detects that it is being executed from Knitr, and returns
a string with the final Markdown from its `save()` method, automatically labeled
to be passed for rendering `asis` (matching the effect of the `result='asis'` 
setting in the Knitr chunk options). This is why we had to use `cat` when we actually wanted to see 
the raw Markdown text.

The `knitr` output mode also turns off the generation of subreports (linked multiple documents) 
and collects everything into a single Markdown string. As a side-note, links to
saved data files will not work if `devtools::build_vignettes()` call was used
to generate a vignette for the R package, due to the `devtools` expectations that the output
must be a single file.

This vignette document was built with `knitr` for demonstrating the `anrep` API. The default intended mode
for the `anrep`, however, is to let the `anrep$save` method call [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) conversion 
utility directly and generate a static Web site with multiple Web pages and data files, while running 
outside of the `Knitr` environment. We call this `html` mode.

The `html` mode would have been used automatically if we just called `report = anrep("Hello World")`
outside of Knitr, or if we forced it with `report = anrep("Hello World",out.formats="html")` even
when running under Knitr.

You will be able to view the results of `html` mode as a full auto-generated Web site following 
the [link](example_sections_report/report-1.html) provided for a larger example script further 
in this document. For now, we will use one more Knitr-rendered example for the purposes of introducing 
`anrep` API features.

You can use other output formats supported by `Pandoc` as values for the `out.formats` argument,
with a caveat that not all types of elements inserted into the generated Markdown are supported by 
every possible Pandoc output format.

# Generating subsections and inserting `htmlwidgets`

The report hierarchy is represented by nested sections as well as by subreports 
(separate report files) linked from their parent reports. Creating another level
of the hierarchy is done by using the appropriate infix operator after the call
to a `add.header` method. In the example below, all reporting 
calls inside the `%anrep>>% { }` code
block will be added to a new subsection one level deeper than what it was before the 
`add.header` call. The original section numbering is restored after the code
block is finished. The default `add.header` call after that simply increments
the section index at the current level.

At the end of this example, we will also add to the report a couple of dynamic plot widgets, 
after testing that the corresponding widget packages are available in this R instance.

*************************************************************************
*Here is the example code. The rendered output follows the code.*

*************************************************************************

```{r warning = FALSE, message = F, cache=FALSE}
report = anrep("Hello World")
report$add.header("First Hello header")
report$add.table(mtcars[1:5,1:6], caption="Hello Table", show.row.names = T)
# The operator %anrep>>% drops into a subsection:
report$add.header("Second header with subsections") %anrep>>% { 
  report$add.header("Subsection under the second header")
  report$add.descr("*Computing things here. Complex computations.*")
  fit = lm(mpg~hp,mtcars)
  report$add.descr("*Having done computing. Took a while.*")
  report$add(fit,caption = "Hello model")
  report$add.header("Another subsection under the second header")
  report$add(with(mtcars,plot(mpg,hp)), caption="Hello Plot",graph.unify=T)
# closing braces restores the previous section level
}
report$add.table(mtcars[5:10,], caption="We are back at the original section level. Hello Table Again")
if(requireNamespace("threejs", quietly = TRUE)) {
  z = seq(-10, 10, 0.01)
  x = cos(z)
  y = sin(z)
  sp3 = threejs::scatterplot3js(x,y,z, color=rainbow(length(z)))
  report$add.widget(sp3,
                    caption = "ThreeJS widget. You can rotate it with your mouse.")
}
report$add.header("Third header, auto-incremented at the same level as the second header")
report$add.printed(lm(mpg~hp,mtcars),caption = "Hello model again")
if(requireNamespace("plotly", quietly = TRUE)) {
  wd = plotly::plot_ly(cbind(Model=rownames(mtcars),mtcars),
                                    x = ~mpg, y = ~qsec, color = ~hp, mode="markers", marker = list(size = ~wt),
                                    text =~paste("Model:", Model, "<br>Weight:", wt))
  report$add.widget(wd,
                    caption = "Dynamic Plotly plot: hover, zoom and brush with your mouse")
}

# The larger example with Subreports

A worked example source file is included with the package, and can be located with this command:

```{r cache=FALSE}
library(anrepr)
example_code_file <- system.file("extdata", "example_sections.R", package = "anrepr",mustWork = TRUE)
```

Below is the code listing of that example. The code uses the `anrep` class API calls to create a report
with multiple nested sections and subreports and to insert a few plots and tables.
Look at the inline comments for the annotation of major steps.

And by **[navigating to this link](example_sections_report/report-1.html)**, you can look at the rendered 
HTML report that the code listed below has produced. In the installed package, the example report directory
can be found with `system.file("doc", "example_sections_report", package = "anrepr")`, and the top-level
report file in that directory is `report-1.html`.

```{r cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
## Workaround from this: https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/1647
rc <- knitr::read_chunk
rc(example_code_file)
```
```{r example_sections_report_functions, cache=FALSE, results="hide", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, comment=NA}
```

After defining the functions above, we run the report generation pipeline expressed by these functions. In the call
below, the generated Markdown code will be converted into HTML only when Pandoc executable is available.

```{r eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, results="hide", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
make_example_sections_report("example_sections_report")
```
```{r eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, results="hide", warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, echo=FALSE}
rep_target <- "../inst/doc"
unlink(file.path(rep_target,"example_sections_report"),recursive = TRUE)
dir.create(rep_target,recursive = TRUE,showWarnings = FALSE)
file.copy("example_sections_report",rep_target,recursive=TRUE,overwrite = TRUE)
```
